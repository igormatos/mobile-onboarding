## Confusion after committing?

###### Did you commit any separate commit that should have gone next to another or missed the message of a commit? You can solve the problem by:
- **Interactive Rebase**

 1. Identify the commit that generated the problem. 
 2. Select the commit just below it and choose the 'Rebase children of XXX interactively' option.
 3. Pop-up will open and a list of commits will be displayed. Identify the one you want.
 4. To edit the message of a commit, select it and click 'Edit message'.
 5. To join two separate commits, drag the desired commit one position above the other desired one and click 'Squash with previous'.

- **Reset Master**

1. Identify the commit that generated the problem.
2. Select the commit just below it and choose the option 'Reset master to this branch'.
3. Any modifications made by you before this commit will return to the file status.
4. Reorganize your commits.
