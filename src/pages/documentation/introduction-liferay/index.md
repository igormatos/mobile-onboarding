## Intro to Liferay Development

Liferay Portal offers developers a complete platform for building web apps, mobile apps, and web services quickly, using features and frameworks designed for rapid development, good performance, and ease of use. The base platform is already there, and itâ€™s built as a robust container for applications that you can put together in far less time than you would from scratch.
It also ships with a default set of common applications that can be make use of right away: web experience management, collaboration applications such as forums and wikis, documents and media, blogs, and more. All of these applications are designed to be customized, as is the system itself.

Liferay Portal ships with suites of applications to get you started building your site quickly.
 
One of the most often cited best characteristics of Liferay is how versatile it is. It can be used to build websites of all sorts, from very large websites with hundreds of thousands of articles, to smaller, highly dynamic and interactive sites. This includes public sites, internal sites like intranets, or mixed environments like collaboration platforms.

Developers often choose Liferay for one of these cases and quickly find that Liferay is a great fit for completely different projects. In short, Liferay was written by developers for developers, to help get the work done faster and more easily.
